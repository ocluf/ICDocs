# Installing the SDK

### MacOs / Linux

* Open a terminal
* Run the command below to install the SDK

```
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://smartcontracts.org/install.sh)"
```

* confirm the install was successful by running the command `dfx -v` which should print out your current version of `dfx` and the commands that you can run.\


### Windows

Windows is not yet supported for the SDK. However you can use Windows Linux Subsystem (WSL) to run it anyways. \
\
TODO: write instructions for using the SDK with Windows.\
